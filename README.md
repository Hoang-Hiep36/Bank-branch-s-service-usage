# The task
- The director of a bank branch needs an overview report on the branch's service usage and customers.
- He wants to know how many customer segments/groups there are currently.
- If the KPI for the next quarter is to increase revenue by 20%, what types of services can be focused on to increase revenue?
# Some insights found
- Although having the same number of customers, Ho Chi Minh City has 4 times more assets than Hanoi => mainly because the number of Gold segment customers in Ho Chi Minh City is 4 times more than Hanoi.
- In Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, only the Regular segment mainly uses the two services of Mortgage Loan and Unsecured Loan while the Gold and Silver segments almost do not use them.
- To increase revenue, banks need to focus on key services including Credit Cards, Mortgages and Unsecured Loans. The number of customers who have not used these three services accounts for 78.6% of the bank's total customers.
